S.No.	Compiler	                                                                        Interpreter
  
1.	Compiler scans the whole program in one go.	                                        Translates program one statement at a time.
2.	As it scans the code in one go, the errors (if any) are shown at the end together.      Considering it scans code one line at a time, errors are shown line by line.
3.	Main advantage of compilers is itâ€™s execution time.	                                Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code, it is preferred less.
4.	It converts the source code into object code.	                                        It does not convert source code into object code instead it scans it line by line.
5	It does not require source code for later execution.	                                It requires source code for later execution.
Example.	C, C++, C# etc.	                                                                 Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc.
